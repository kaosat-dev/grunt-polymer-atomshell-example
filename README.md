building a release
------------------
Various builds targets (browser, desktop, standalone or integration) are available ,
but it is advised to only build the specific version you require as some of these can
take a bit of time to generate.

Once a build is complete, you will find the resulting files in the build/target-subtarget 
folder : for example: **build/browser-integration** or **build/desktop-standalone** etc

To build a **standalone** app for usage on the desktop using the provided demo index.html

    $ grunt build:desktop:standalone


To build it **standalone** for usage in the browser using the provided demo index.html

    $ grunt build:browser:standalone
    
    
To build the example component for **integration** into a website:

    $ grunt build:browser:integration


optional build flags:
---------------------

 - --minify
 - --appname xxxx : where xxx is the name of the app you want (desktop only)
 - --compress : generated a zip file of the whole app folder (desktop only)

Notes:
------
 - tested on debian wheezey(mix of stable and unstable, yikes) 64 bit
 - in wheezy stable, there are issues with glibc, a mix of stable and unstable can help
